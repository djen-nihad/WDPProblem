# WDPProblem

The Winner Determination Problem is a fundamental challenge in combinatorial auctions, where the goal is to determine the winners and 
winning prices for various auction lots. In this project, we adopt a hybrid approach by combining the BSO (Bees Swarm Optimization)
metaheuristic technique with local search algorithms. 

# Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

methaheurstique/: This directory contains the resolution program's source code for implementing the metaheuristic algorithms.

benchmarks/: This directory contains the files for testing and benchmarking the performance of the implemented algorithms.

Interface/: This directory contains the source code for the Java Swing-based user interface.


# Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure the following prerequisites are installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) library

You can download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website.

To import the JADE library into your project, you can follow these steps:

Download the JADE library from the official website.
Extract the downloaded archive to a directory on your local machine.
In your Java project, add the JADE library to your classpath or import it as a dependency using a build tool such as Maven or Gradle.
